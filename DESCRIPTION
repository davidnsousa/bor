Description: Transforms focal observations' data, where different types of social interactions
  can be recorded by multiple observers, into asymmetric data matrices.
  Each cell in these matrices provides counts on the number of times
  a specific type of social interaction was initiated by the row subject and
  directed to the column subject.
